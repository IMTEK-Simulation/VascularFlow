        The flow rate of the fluid through the pipe.
    radius : np.ndarray
        The radius of the pipe as a function of position along the pipe.
    length : float
        The length of the pipe.
    viscosity : float
        The viscosity of the fluid.

    Returns
    -------
    pressure_drop : float
        The pressure drop across the pipe as a function of position along the pipe.
